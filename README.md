She is my personal assistant developed in increasing my productivity and helping me in everyday tasks. The thing to know about C.L.A.I.R.E. is that she is a bit shy, so you will have to familiarize yourself with her 
in order to utilize her capabilities to the fullest. She requires a bit of setup and customizations, but once they are done, she will be your one stop to productivity!
